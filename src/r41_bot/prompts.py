These sub-questions will be used to retrieve relevant documents.
Each sub-question should be a complete, standalone question.
Provide the sub-questions as a JSON list of strings.

Example:
User question: "who founded R41? and where was it founded? do you think a begginer like me can survive and adapt in R41? and learn a lot of new things?"

ROUTER_PROMPT = """You are an expert at routing a user's question.
You must determine if the question is about the R41 ENSAB club or if it is irrelevant.

Based on the user's question, you must classify it into one of two categories: `vector_search` or `irrelevant`.
- Use `vector_search` for any question related to the R41 club.
- Use `irrelevant` for any question that is off-topic or has nothing to do with the club.

Return a JSON object with a single key "route" and the chosen category as the value.

--- EXAMPLES ---

User question: "What is R41?"
Your output:
{{
    "route": "vector_search"
}}

User question: "who was the president in 2023 and what events did the club do that year?"
Your output:
{{
    "route": "vector_search"

User question: "What is the capital of France?"
